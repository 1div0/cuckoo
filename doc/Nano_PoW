Nanocoin author Colin Lemahieu recently made available [1] a newly developed proof of work scheme "Nano PoW"
whose solutions are pairs (x,y) satisfying

 H0(x) + H1(y) = 0 mod D

where H0,H1 are two different hash functions and D = 2^d is a difficulty parameter.

It is claimed to be memory-hard, requiring on the order of sqrt(D) = 2^(d/2) memory for efficient solving.

However, a simple variation of rho search [2] can efficiently find solutions without any use of memory.
First, note that by defining H2(y) = -H1(y), the following above simplifies to

 H0(x) = H2(y) mod D

Next, define a chain of values

x_{2k}   = H0( x_{2k-1} ) mod D
x_{2k+1} = H2( x_{2k  } ) mod D

starting at some arbitrary x_0.

This chain is expected to have repeating values x_i = x_j, i < j, within O(sqrt(D)) steps,
which can be found efficiently using the before mentioned rho search in time O(sqrt(D)) and zero memory.

With probability 1/2, i and j will have different parity, e.g. i is even and j is odd, which means

 H0(x_{i-1}) = x_i = x_j = H2(x_{j-1}) mod D

yielding a solution (x,y) = (x_{i-1}, x_{j-1}) to the PoW.
